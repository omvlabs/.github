## About

**OMVLabs** is an open-source organization focused on building and maintaining
technology projects across the broader software and systems landscape.

We operate with a long-term mindset — prioritizing clarity, correctness,
and community over trends or hype.

---

## Focus

OMVLabs is intentionally **domain-agnostic**.  
Projects may span areas such as:

- Systems & infrastructure
- Developer tooling
- Web & backend engineering
- Cloud-native patterns
- Experimental and research-driven work

The common thread is **strong engineering foundations**.

---

## Principles

- Open by default  
- Designed to be built upon  
- Documentation matters  
- Community over individual ownership  

---

## Status

OMVLabs is in an **early foundation stage**.
Projects and contribution guidelines will be added incrementally as they mature.
